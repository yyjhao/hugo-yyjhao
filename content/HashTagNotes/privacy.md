# Privacy Policy

This policy applies to all information collected or submitted by the HashTagNotes application for iPhone, iPad or Mac.

# Information Collection

HashTagNotes does not collect or retain any personal identifying information as part of its core functions.

Apple may collect crash logs if the privacy settings of your device allow it.

# CloudKit and iCloud

HashTagNotes uses Apple CloudKit to sync data between your Apple devices (iPhone, iPad and Mac). Your data is stored in a private database, which is encrypted with an account-based key. Therefore, we do not have access to any data stored in your iCloud account. We also do not have access to your Apple ID - only a unique identifier that is scoped to just our app. It is not possible to track your identity between apps with this identifier.

# Childrenâ€™s Privacy

HashTagNotes is not designed to attract anyone under the age of 13. No identfying information is retained by HashTagNotes regardless of age.

# Your Consent

By using HashTagNotes, you consent to this privacy policy.
